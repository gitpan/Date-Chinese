=head1 NAME

Date::Chinese - Calculate dates in the Chinese calendar

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Date::Chinese;

  $year = yearofthe( 1999 ); # "Year of the hare"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please note that the API of this module is I<guaranteed> to change in
future versions. I'll hopefully be adding more details about the date,
rather than just the year. And this will be a Date::ICal subclass, so
that conversions directly from ICal to Chinese to ISO, for example,
will be very simple.

You should also note that the Chinese new year does not conicide with
the Gregorian new year, so the determination of what year it is in the
Chinese calendar is only going to be correct for a portion of te
Gregorian year. I am trying to gain a better understanding of the
various issues involved, so that I can have more accurate
calculations. Meanwhile, this may amuse you while you're waiting for
the real thing.

=head1 About the Chinese calendar

Reference: The Oxford Companion to the Year - Bonnie Blackburn and
Leofranc Holford-Strevens. Pg 696-707

The Chinese calendar 19 year cycle. Seven of these 19 years have 13
months, and the rest have 12. There's a whole heck of a lot more to it
than the 12 animals that you see on your placemat at your favorite
Chinese restaurant.

There is a cycle of 10 stems and 12 branches. Each stem has associated
with it an element (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) a yang (fir,
kindling, hill, weapons, waves) a yin (bamboo, lamp-flame, plain,
kettle, brooks) a cardinal point (east, south, centre, west, north)
and a planet (Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury).

Likewise, each branch has associated with it an animal, an element, a
double-hour, a compass point, and a sign of the zodiac.

Each of these various cycles are going on at the same time, and so
interact with each other to produce combinations of all of these
different components. And various combinations mean various things.

There are, of course, many folks that have more knowledge of how this
all works than I do. I'm just a mathematician.
http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/chinese.shtml seems like
a goo place to start, but there are many other very informative sites
on the net.
